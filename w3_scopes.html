    <h3>AngularJS Scope</h3>
    The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JS (controller). <br>
    The scope is an obj with the available properties and methods. <br>
    The scope is available for both the view and the controller.
    <hr>

    <h3>How to use the Scope</h3>
    <!-- <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
        <h1>{{carName}}</h1>
    </div>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
        app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
            $scope.carName = "Judsons";
        });
    </script> -->
    <hr>

    <h3>Understanding the Scope</h3>
    If we consider an ANgularJS application to consist of: 
    <ul>
        <li>View, which is the HTML</li>
        <li>Model, which is the dat available for the current view</li>
        <li>Controller, which is the JS function that makes/changes/removes/contrls the data</li>
    </ul>
    <em>The Scope is the model</em>
    <hr>

    <h3>Know your Scope</h3>
    It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time. <br>
    <!-- <div ng-app="myApps" ng-controller="myCtrls">
        <ul>
            <li ng-repeat="i in names">{{i}}</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module('myApps', []);
        app.controller('myCtrls', function($scope) {
            $scope.names = ["Email", "Tobias", "Linus"]
        });
    </script> -->
    <hr>

    <h3>Root Scope</h3>
    All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML elemnet that contains the ng-app directive. <br>
    The rootScope is available in the entire application <br>
    If a var has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.
    <hr>

    <p>The rootScope's favorite color:</p>
    <h1>{{color}}</h1>
    -------------------------------------

    <div ng-controller="myCtrl">
        <p>The scope of the controller's favorite color:</p>
        <h1>{{color}}</h1>
    </div>
    -------------------------------------

    <div ng-controller="mySecondCtrl">
        <p>The scope of the second controller's favorite color:</p>
        <h1>{{color}}</h1>
    </div>
    -------------------------------------

    <p>The rootScope's favorite color is still:</p>
    <h1>{{color}}</h1>
    -------------------------------------

    <script>
        var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
        
        app.run(function($rootScope) {
            $rootScope.color = 'blue';
        });
        
        app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
            $scope.color = "red";
        });

        app.controller('mySecondCtrl', function ($scope) {
                $scope.color = "green";
            });
