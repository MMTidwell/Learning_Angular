    <h3>
        An AngularJS module defines an application. <br>
        The module is a container for the different parts of an application <br>
        The module is a container for the application controllers <br>
        Controllers always belong to a module
    </h3>

    <h3>Creating a Module</h3>
    A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; ex: var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
    <hr>

    <h3>Adding a controller</h3>
    Add acontroller to your application and refer to the contrller with the ng-controller directive <br><br>
    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
        Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}
    </div>

    <script>
        var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

        app.controller("myCtrl", function ($scope) {
            $scope.firstName = "John";
            $scope.lastName = "Doe";

    <h3>Adding a directive</h3>
    AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add funcionality to your application. <br>
    <em>This does work but above script must be commented out for it to work</em> <br><br>
    <div ng-app="myApps" w3-test-directive></div>
    <script>
        var apps = angular.module("myApps", []);

        apps.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
            return {
                template: "I was made in a directive constructor!"
            };
        });
    </script>
